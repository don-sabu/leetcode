# [238. Product of Array Except Self](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self)

![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem Statement

Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.

> **Example 1:**
>
> Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]  
> Output: [24,12,8,6]  

> **Example 2:**
>
> Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]  
> Output: [0,0,9,0,0]  

### Constraints:

- 2 <= nums.length <= 105  
- -30 <= nums[i] <= 30  
- The input is generated such that answer[i] is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.  

## My Code
```python
class Solution:
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        product = 1
        z_count = 0
        for num in nums:
            if num != 0:
                product *= num
            else:
                z_count +=1
        
        if z_count > 1:
            return [0] * len(nums)
        
        res = []
        if z_count == 1:
            for num in nums:
                if num == 0:
                    res.append(product)
                else:
                    res.append(0)
            return res

        for num in nums:
            res.append(int(product/num))
        return res
```
## Explanation

This solution calculates the product of all nonzero numbers in the array.  
- First, it iterates over `nums` to compute the total product while counting the number of zeros.  
- If more than one zero is present, the result is all zeros because multiplying by zero results in zero.  
- If exactly one zero exists, only the position with zero gets the total product, while all others remain zero.  
- If there are no zeros, we divide the total product by each element to get the result.  

This approach avoids using division in the main logic and ensures an O(n) runtime. ðŸš€
