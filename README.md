### Why am I doing this?

I am creating this repository to easily keep track of the problems I solve on LeetCode. This will allow me to conveniently review and revise the solutions that I have worked on. Not only will this help me in improving my problem-solving skills, but others can also use this repository to prepare for interviews or practice common coding problems.

### My workflow
- To choose a problem, I am following the roadmap given in [this](https://neetcode.io/roadmap) website.
- Find that problem in [leetcode](https://leetcode.com) and solves it. If I am not able to solve, either I look into articles or YouTube.
- To update that in this repo, I use [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com). I paste the question and my solution in this [prompt](utils/prompt.md).
- The result will give me the name for the file to be created [here](solutions), contents to be pasted in that file and code to update the [table](#problems).

Happy coding! ðŸŽ‰
